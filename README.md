# 🚖 Sweet Lift Taxi Demand Prediction

This project analyzes historical taxi order data from **Sweet Lift Taxi** to predict hourly demand using regression models. The goal is to help optimize fleet allocation and 
improve customer satisfaction by forecasting future demand.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze hourly patterns in taxi orders
- Engineer time-based features
- Train multiple regression models to predict demand
- Evaluate model performance with RMSE (target threshold: < 48)

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `Sweet Lift Taxi Project.ipynb`: Main notebook with data processing, modeling, and evaluation

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
